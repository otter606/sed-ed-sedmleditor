This is the README file for the SED-ED SEDML editor, released August 2011.

What's new this version:

New features
1) Can now obtain SBML models from BioModels referenced by a Miriam URN ( needs internet connection ).
2) Elements that have notes have a note icon displayed inside their shape to indicate this.
3) Adding/editing notes is now un-doable.
4) Navigation around the document 1). 
   For an active editor,if you click on a SEDML  element in the project view, it will be highlighted in the graphical editor.
5) Navigation around the document 2).
	 You can limit the graphical view to only a subset of elements by selecting an 'Output' element and choosing 'REstric View' from 
	  the context menu, this shows only those elements in the workflow needed to produce the output.
See the embedded help documentation for details.
